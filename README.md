# ChattyLittleNPC - Vanilla AI Voiceover Packs
AI-generated voiceover packs for the [ChattyLittleNPC](https://github.com/mantaskazlauskas/ChattyLittleNpc) addon, covering World of Warcraft: Classic (Vanilla) quests and NPC gossip. Each language is a separate pack you install alongside ChattyLittleNPC.

## For players

### Installing
1. Install ChattyLittleNPC.
2. Download the ZIP for your language from the [Releases](https://github.com/mantaskazlauskas/ChattyLittleNPC-Vanilla-English-Voiceover-pack/releases) page, e.g. `ChattyLittleNpc_Vanilla_enUS_voiceovers-v3.3.5.zip`.
3. Extract it into `World of Warcraft/<version>/Interface/AddOns/`. You should end up with `Interface/AddOns/ChattyLittleNpc_Vanilla_enUS_voiceovers/`.

By default, ChattyLittleNPC plays voiceovers in your game client's language if a pack for it is installed, and English otherwise. When your language's pack has no recording for a line, it plays the English one. Install the English pack as well to get that fallback. You can pick the language and turn the fallback off in ChattyLittleNPC's settings.

### Upgrading from 3.3.4 or earlier
The English pack folder was renamed from `ChattyLittleNpc_Vanilla_voiceovers` to `ChattyLittleNpc_Vanilla_enUS_voiceovers`. **Delete the old `ChattyLittleNpc_Vanilla_voiceovers` folder** from `Interface/AddOns`. Otherwise both packs load, and the old one never gets updates.

## For maintainers

### Repository layout
Every top-level folder that contains a `.toc` with the same name is one addon, and each addon is one language:

```
ChattyLittleNpc_Vanilla_enUS_voiceovers/       <- English pack
    ChattyLittleNpc_Vanilla_enUS_voiceovers.toc   version, title, file list
    Main.lua                                      registers the pack's global table
    VoiceoversList.lua                            GENERATED: file list + durations
    voiceovers/                                   the .ogg files, directly in this folder
ChattyLittleNpc_Vanilla_deDE_voiceovers/       <- e.g. a German pack, same structure
generate_voiceovers_list.py                    builds VoiceoversList.lua for every pack
deploy.py                                      copies packs into your local WoW install
release.py                                     tags a version and creates the GitHub release
.github/workflows/release.yml                  builds one ZIP per pack when a release is published
```

The folder name matters. ChattyLittleNPC finds packs by the pattern `ChattyLittleNpc_<Expansion>_<locale>_voiceovers` and reads the language from `<locale>`, which is a WoW client locale code: `enUS`, `deDE`, `frFR`, `esES`, `esMX`, `ptBR`, `itIT`, `ruRU`, `koKR`, `zhCN` or `zhTW`. The folder name, the `.toc` name and the global name in `Main.lua` must all match exactly.

### One-time setup
```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\pip install mutagen     # the generator uses it to read audio durations
```
- `release.py` needs the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), logged in with `gh auth login`.
- `deploy.py` copies to `WOW_ROOT`, set near the top of the script. It is currently the maintainer's own path (`D:\Games\World of Warcraft`). **Change it to the folder where World of Warcraft is installed on your machine** (the one containing `_retail_`, `_classic_era_` and so on) before running the script.
- Commits that change `.github/workflows/` can only be pushed with a token that has `workflow` scope. If a push is rejected with `refusing to allow an OAuth App to create or update workflow`, run `gh auth refresh -h github.com -s workflow` and then `gh auth setup-git`, and push again.

### Adding a new language
Example: German (`deDE`).

1. Create the folder `ChattyLittleNpc_Vanilla_deDE_voiceovers/`.
2. Copy `Main.lua` and the `.toc` from the English folder into it.
3. Rename the `.toc` to `ChattyLittleNpc_Vanilla_deDE_voiceovers.toc`.
4. In the `.toc`, change `## Title` to `Chatty Little NPC: Vanilla voiceovers (deDE)` so players can tell the packs apart in the AddOns list. Set `## Version` too.
5. In `Main.lua`, replace every `ChattyLittleNpc_Vanilla_enUS_voiceovers` with `ChattyLittleNpc_Vanilla_deDE_voiceovers`. The `Contains...Voiceovers` flags are informational only; ChattyLittleNPC doesn't use them for playback.
6. Put the audio directly in `ChattyLittleNpc_Vanilla_deDE_voiceovers/voiceovers/`, with no subfolders. Use the same file names as the English pack, because ChattyLittleNPC looks voiceovers up by file name (see [File naming](#file-naming)).
7. Generate the file list (see the next section) and commit.

Nothing else needs to change. The generator, `deploy.py`, `release.py` and the release workflow all pick up the new folder automatically. The one exception is CurseForge: `pkgmeta.yaml` only describes the English pack.

### File naming
Files must be `.ogg`. The generator also lists `.mp3` files, but ChattyLittleNPC only looks for `.ogg` names, so an `.mp3` never plays.

| Kind | File name |
|---|---|
| Quest text | `<questId>_Desc.ogg`, `<questId>_Prog.ogg`, `<questId>_Comp.ogg` (description, progress, completion) |
| Quest greeting | `<npcId>_QuestGreeting.ogg` |
| Gossip / game object / item | `<id>_Gossip_<hash>[_<Male\|Female\|Neutral>].ogg`, likewise `_GameObject_` and `_Item_`. The gender suffix is optional. |

### Adding or updating voiceovers
1. Add or replace `.ogg` files directly in the pack's `voiceovers/` folder (no subfolders).
2. Regenerate `VoiceoversList.lua`:
   ```powershell
   .venv\Scripts\python generate_voiceovers_list.py                                         # every pack
   .venv\Scripts\python generate_voiceovers_list.py ChattyLittleNpc_Vanilla_deDE_voiceovers  # one pack
   ```
   ChattyLittleNPC only knows about files listed here, so a file that isn't in the list never plays.
3. Bump `## Version` in that pack's `.toc`.

The release workflow regenerates the list too, so a stale committed list can't end up in a release. Regenerating locally is still needed for local testing.

### Testing in game
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python deploy.py
```
The script asks which pack to deploy (or `a` for all of them) and which WoW version (Retail, Classic Era, Anniversary, ...). It then replaces that pack's folder in `Interface/AddOns`. Run `/reload` in game, or restart the client if you added new files.

### Releasing
**Only the repository owner (@mantaskazlauskas) publishes releases.** Contributors: open a pull request with your changes, and the owner will release them. What enforces this is write access: creating tags and releases needs it, and only the owner has it. As a safety net against accidental releases, the release workflow also skips building unless the owner published the release.

All packs are released together under one tag. The tag comes from `## Version` in the **English** `.toc`.

1. Bump `## Version` in the English `.toc`, plus any other pack that changed. If the versions differ, `release.py` warns you, but every pack is still built under the English version's tag.
2. Commit and push to `main`.
3. Dry run to check the version and tag:
   ```powershell
   python release.py
   ```
4. Create the release:
   ```powershell
   python release.py --create                 # v3.3.5
   python release.py --create --type beta     # v3.3.5-beta (marked as a pre-release)
   python release.py --create --type alpha    # v3.3.5-alpha (marked as a pre-release)
   ```
   This creates and pushes the git tag, then creates the GitHub release. To redo a version that already exists, first delete its GitHub release with `gh release delete v3.3.5`, then run with `--force`. `--force` only replaces the tag, not the release.
5. The **Package WoW Addon** workflow runs automatically. It regenerates every `VoiceoversList.lua`, zips each pack folder, and attaches one ZIP per language to the release:
   ```
   ChattyLittleNpc_Vanilla_enUS_voiceovers-v3.3.5.zip
   ChattyLittleNpc_Vanilla_deDE_voiceovers-v3.3.5.zip
   ```
   You can follow it in the repository's **Actions** tab. When it finishes, the ZIPs appear on the release page.
